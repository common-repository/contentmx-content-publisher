Post authorized content from your ContentMX account to your WordPress blog/website.

== Description ==

This plugin connects your WordPress blog/website with your ContentMX account allowing you to publish authorized content from your favorite vendors and manufacturers directly to WordPress. This plug-in works securely with ContentMX co-branded platforms such as Microsoft DMC (Digital Marketing Content OnDemand), TD SYNNEX DEMANDSolv, and Arrow's Curated Content.

Please note, this plugin relies on a third-party connection with https://contentmx.com. The plugin will initially use a secure token to create a connection to your account on contentmx.com. Once established this secure connection will be used to publish content you choose to publish to your WordPress blog from your ContentMX account. You can terminate this connection at any time within the plugin administration panel, in your contentMX account, or by deactivating the plugin.
